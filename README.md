## Project Overview

For this project, our group decided to work with firebase along with React and Router to build an application with a simple backend that we could post to and fetch data from. We wanted to make an application that could crowdsource advice to anyone who was willing to share or in need of advice. We also added an extra fetch to a public api for randomly generated advice. In the future we would like to make it user authenticated so that the advice is saved persoanlly to each user that wants to keep track of the advice they have collected.

## Goals
For this project we wanted to learn and experiment working with a backend that we created and could manipulate and were successful in doing so.

## Technologies
Javascript
React
Router
Node
Jest
CSS
Bootstrap
Firebase/Firestore

## Challenges
User Authentication and testing with router

## Wins
We can post to our database in cloud firestore and recieve all the data back.
